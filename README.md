Travel Time

Overview

This project leverages Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and essential data structures such as Maps, Stacks, and Sets to efficiently determine the shortest routes from a station to every other station. By organizing station data and managing a sorted stack, it ensures accurate calculations while visiting each station only once. This was developed as a class project to apply and demonstrate the application of algorithms and data structures in solving shortest path problems.

Features

Shortest Path Calculation: Computes the shortest routes from a starting station to all other stations.

Efficient Data Management: Utilizes Maps, Stacks, and Sets to handle and process station data efficiently.

Single Visit: Ensures each station is visited only once to maintain efficiency and accuracy.
